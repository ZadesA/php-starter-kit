# PHP Starter Kit

Basic examples written in PHP to help people who are starting to learn the language.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the files up and running on your local machine for development and testing.

### Prerequisites

The things you need before installing the starter kit.

* 
* Any code editor that supports both HTML and PHP
* A MariaDB server or any local server that supports SQL.
* Basic knowledge about HTML

### Installation

A step by step guide that will tell you how to get the development environment up and running.

```
- Set up a MariaDB server, a useful video can be linked here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCHXCusltqI
- Set up your htdocs folder (if not yet) to run any example file from the starter kit. Should be under the "xampp" folder (i.e C:\xampp\htdocs)
- Create a new folder under the htdocs folder and name it whatever you like, for example 'C:\xampp\htdocs\yourname\' and place any example file from this repository that you want.
```

## Usage

A few examples of useful commands and/or tasks.

```
- Launch both the 'Apache' and the 'MySQL' modules from the XAMPP control panel.
- In your browser's URL search bar search for 'localhost/' and follow that with the name of the folder you named under htdocs,
  for example if your folder under the 'htdocs' folder is named "James" then the URL should be 'localhost/James/' and follow that with a filename and extension of your choice. (i.e localhost/James/Example.php)
```
